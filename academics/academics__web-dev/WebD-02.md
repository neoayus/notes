# XTML Form elements

Forms are an essential part of web pages, enabling user interaction by allowing the submission of data to a server. In XHTML, forms are created using the `<form>` tag, along with various input elements such as text fields, buttons, checkboxes, radio buttons, and more.

## Labels in XHTML

Labels are used to enhance the accessibility and usability of forms. The `<label>` tag is specifically designed to associate text with form elements like input fields, checkboxes, radio buttons, and more. 
### Basic Structure and Usage

The `<label>` tag can be associated with a form element in two ways: 

1. **Using the `for` Attribute**: The `for` attribute links the label to a specific form element by matching the value of the `for` attribute to the `id` of the form element.
   
   Example:
   ```xhtml
   <label for="username">Username:</label>
   <input type="text" id="username" name="username">
   ```

   In this example, the label "Username:" is associated with the input field. When a user clicks on the label, the corresponding input field is automatically focused, improving usability.

2. **Wrapping the Form Element**: The form element can be nested directly within the `<label>` tag, eliminating the need for the `for` attribute.

   Example:
   ```xhtml
   <label>Username: <input type="text" name="username"></label>
   ```

   In this approach, clicking on the label also focuses the associated input field.

## Text Boxes in XHTML

Text boxes, also known as text input fields, who are a fundamental component of forms in XHTML. They allow users to enter and submit textual data, such as names, emails, passwords, or any other type of text-based information. Text boxes are created using the `<input>` tag with the `type` attribute set to `"text"`, `"password"`, or `"email"`, depending on the desired input.

A ***standard text box*** is created using the `<input>` tag with the `type="text"` attribute. This creates a single-line text input field where users can type their information.

```xhtml
<label for="username">Username:</label>
<input type="text" id="username" name="username">
```
### Types of Text Boxes

1. **Standard Text Box (`type="text"`)**:
   - Used for general-purpose text input.
   - Accepts any type of textual data.
   - Example:
   ```xhtml
   <input type="text" name="firstname">
   ```

2. **Password Text Box (`type="password"`)**:
   - Used for entering sensitive information like passwords.
   - The characters entered are masked (usually displayed as dots or asterisks) to ensure privacy.
   - Example:
   ```xhtml
   <input type="password" name="userpassword">
   ```

3. **Email Text Box (`type="email"`)**:
   - Specifically designed to handle email addresses.
   - Some browsers may provide additional validation to ensure the input is a valid email format.
   - Example:
   ```xhtml
   <input type="email" name="useremail">
   ```

### Additional Attributes

- **`name`**: Specifies the name of the input field, which is used when sending form data to the server.
  ```xhtml
  <input type="text" name="username">
  ```

- **`placeholder`**: Provides a hint to the user about what should be entered in the text box. The placeholder text is visible inside the input field until the user starts typing.
  ```xhtml
  <input type="text" name="username" placeholder="Enter your username">
  ```

- **`value`**: Sets a default value for the text box, which appears as the initial content of the input field.
  ```xhtml
  <input type="text" name="username" value="defaultUsername">
  ```

Text boxes are created using the `<input>` tag with the `type` attribute set to `"text"`, `"password"`, or `"email"`, depending on the desired input.

### Basic Structure of a Text Box

A standard text box is created using the `<input>` tag with the `type="text"` attribute. This creates a single-line text input field where users can type their information.

Example:

```xhtml
<label for="username">Username:</label>
<input type="text" id="username" name="username">
```

In this example, the label "Username:" is associated with the text box, and users can enter their username into the field. The `id` attribute links the label to the input field, ensuring that clicking on the label will focus the text box.

### Types of Text Boxes

1. **Standard Text Box (`type="text"`)**:
   - Used for general-purpose text input.
   - Accepts any type of textual data.
   - Example:
   ```xhtml

  ```xhtml
  <input type="text" name="username" value="defaultUsername">
  ```

## Button, Submit, and Reset 

Buttons are essential elements in forms that trigger specific actions. In XHTML, the `<button>`, `<input type="submit">`, and `<input type="reset">` elements are used to create interactive buttons.

### Button (`<button>`)

The `<button>` element creates a clickable button that can contain text or other elements like images. It’s versatile and can be used to perform custom actions, often with the help of JavaScript.

```xhtml
<button type="button" onclick="alert('Button clicked!')">Click Me</button>
```

### Submit (`<input type="submit">`)

The `<input type="submit">` element creates a button that submits the form data to the server when clicked. It’s a straightforward way to send user inputs to the server.

```xhtml
<input type="submit" value="Submit Form">
```
### Reset (`<input type="reset">`)

The `<input type="reset">` element creates a button that resets all form fields to their initial values, clearing any input entered by the user.

```xhtml
<input type="reset" value="Reset Form">
```
When the reset button is clicked, all the fields in the form are cleared, returning them to their default state.

## MISC 
### Placeholder Attribute

The `placeholder` attribute provides a hint to the user about what to enter in a form field. It displays text inside the input field until the user starts typing.

```xhtml
<input type="text" name="username" placeholder="Enter your username">
```
In this example, the text "Enter your username" appears inside the text box until the user begins entering their username.

### Textarea

The `<textarea>` element is used for multi-line text input, allowing users to enter longer pieces of text, such as comments or descriptions.

```xhtml
<label for="comments">Comments:</label>
<textarea id="comments" name="comments" rows="4" cols="50" placeholder="Enter your comments here"></textarea>
```
This creates a text area with four rows and fifty columns, where users can enter their comments. The `placeholder` attribute provides guidance on what to enter.

## Radio Buttons

Radio buttons allow users to select one option from a group of choices. They are created using the `<input type="radio">` element.

**All radio buttons with the same `name` attribute are grouped together, allowing only one selection.**

```xhtml
<label><input type="radio" name="gender" value="male"> Male</label>
<label><input type="radio" name="gender" value="female"> Female</label>
<label><input type="radio" name="gender" value="other"> Other</label>
```

## Checkboxes

Checkboxes allow users to select one or more options from a list. They are created using the `<input type="checkbox">` element.

Example:
```xhtml
<label><input type="checkbox" name="hobby" value="reading"> Reading</label>
<label><input type="checkbox" name="hobby" value="traveling"> Traveling</label>
<label><input type="checkbox" name="hobby" value="cooking"> Cooking</label>
```
Here, users can select multiple hobbies from the list of checkboxes.

## Dropdown Menu (`<select>`)

The `<select>` element creates a dropdown menu, allowing users to choose one option from a list of predefined choices. Each option is defined using the `<option>` tag.

```xhtml
<label for="country">Choose your country:</label>
<select id="country" name="country">
   <option value="us">United States</option>
   <option value="uk">United Kingdom</option>
   <option value="ca">Canada</option>
   <option value="au">Australia</option>
</select>
```

# Introduction to CSS. 

CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is a stylesheet language used to control the appearance and layout of web pages. It separates the content of a web page (HTML) from its design, enabling developers to style and format the visual presentation of HTML elements consistently across a site.

### The Role of CSS

CSS is responsible for defining the look and feel of a web page. While HTML structures the content, CSS allows you to specify styles such as colors, fonts, spacing, and positioning. By using CSS, you can ensure that a website’s design is consistent, maintainable, and adaptable to different screen sizes and devices.

### Basic Structure of CSS

CSS consists of a series of rules. Each rule targets specific HTML elements and defines how they should be styled. A CSS rule is composed of a **selector** and a **declaration block**.

- **Selector**: The selector targets the HTML element(s) to which the style will be applied.
- **Declaration Block**: The declaration block contains one or more declarations, each consisting of a **property** and a **value**. Properties define aspects like color or font-size, while values specify the settings for those properties.

```css
p {
	proprty value
	color: blue;
	font-size: 16px;
}
```

### Applying CSS

CSS can be applied to HTML documents in three ways:

1. **Inline CSS**: Styles are applied directly to an HTML element using the `style` attribute.
   ```html
   <p style="color: blue;">This is a blue paragraph.</p>
   ```

2. **Internal CSS**: Styles are defined within a `<style>` tag in the `<head>` section of the HTML document.
   ```html
   <style>
      p {
         color: blue;
      }
   </style>
   ```

3. **External CSS**: Styles are defined in an external `.css` file, which is linked to the HTML document using the `<link>` tag.
   ```html
   <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
   ```


### Cascading and Specificity
The "Cascading" in CSS refers to the process by which the browser decides which CSS rules to apply when multiple rules target the same element. This process is influenced by specificity, importance, and source order.

- **Specificity**: Determines which rule is applied based on how specific the selector is. For example, an ID selector (`#id`) is more specific than a class selector (`.class`).
- **Cascading Order**: If two rules have the same specificity, the rule that appears last in the CSS (or last in the order of importance) will be applied.

### CSS Box Model

The CSS box model is a fundamental concept that defines the structure of an element’s space. It consists of the following:

- **Content**: The actual content of the element (text, image, etc.).
- **Padding**: The space between the content and the element's border.
- **Border**: The boundary around the padding and content.
- **Margin**: The space outside the border, separating the element from other elements.

## CSS Properties

CSS properties are the building blocks of CSS, defining the appearance and layout of HTML elements on a webpage. Each property controls a specific aspect of an element's style, such as color, size, positioning, and more. 
### Categories of CSS Properties

CSS properties are typically grouped into several categories based on their function:

#### 1. **Text Properties**

These properties control the appearance of text within an element.

- **`color`**: Sets the color of the text.
  ```css
  color: blue;
  ```

- **`font-size`**: Specifies the size of the text.
  ```css
  font-size: 16px;
  ```

- **`font-family`**: Defines the font used for the text.
  ```css
  font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
  ```

- **`text-align`**: Aligns the text within an element (left, right, center, or justify).
  ```css
  text-align: center;
  ```

- **`line-height`**: Sets the spacing between lines of text.
  ```css
  line-height: 1.5;
  ```

#### 2. **Box Model Properties**

These properties define the layout and spacing around elements using the CSS box model.

- **`width`** and **`height`**: Set the width and height of an element.
  ```css
  width: 300px;
  height: 150px;
  ```

- **`padding`**: Creates space between the content and the border of an element.
  ```css
  padding: 10px;
  ```

- **`border`**: Defines the border around an element, including its width, style, and color.
  ```css
  border: 2px solid black;
  ```

- **`margin`**: Creates space outside the border, separating the element from adjacent elements.
  ```css
  margin: 20px;
  ```

#### 3. **Background Properties**

These properties control the background of an element.

- **`background-color`**: Sets the background color of an element.
  ```css
  background-color: lightgray;
  ```

- **`background-image`**: Specifies an image to be used as the background.
  ```css
  background-image: url('background.jpg');
  ```

- **`background-size`**: Controls the size of the background image (cover, contain, or specific size).
  ```css
  background-size: cover;
  ```

- **`background-position`**: Positions the background image within the element.
  ```css
  background-position: center;
  ```

#### 4. **Positioning Properties**

These properties define how elements are positioned on the page.

- **`position`**: Sets the positioning method for an element (static, relative, absolute, fixed, or sticky).
  ```css
  position: absolute;
  top: 50px;
  left: 100px;
  ```

- **`z-index`**: Controls the stacking order of elements, with higher values appearing above lower ones.
  ```css
  z-index: 10;
  ```

- **`float`**: Allows an element to float to the left or right, enabling text wrapping around it.
  ```css
  float: right;
  ```

- **`display`**: Controls how an element is displayed (block, inline, inline-block, none).
  ```css
  display: block;
  ```

## CSS Selectors

CSS selectors are patterns used to target and apply styles to specific HTML elements within a web page. They are the first part of a CSS rule and determine which elements the accompanying styles will be applied to. Understanding CSS selectors is fundamental to controlling the appearance of different parts of your web page efficiently and effectively.

### Basic Selectors

1. **Universal Selector (`*`)**: 
   The universal selector targets all elements on a web page. It is rarely used alone but can be useful for applying a base style across all elements.
   ```css
   * {
      margin: 0;
      padding: 0;
   }
   ```

2. **Type Selector**:
   The type selector targets elements by their tag name (e.g., `p` for paragraphs, `h1` for headings).
   ```css
   p {
      font-size: 16px;
   }
   ```

3. **Class Selector (`.`)**:
   The class selector targets elements that have a specific class attribute. Classes are reusable across multiple elements.
   ```css
   .highlight {
      background-color: yellow;
   }
   ```

4. **ID Selector (`#`)**:
   The ID selector targets a single element with a unique `id` attribute. IDs should be unique within a page.
   ```css
   #header {
      text-align: center;
   }
   ```
### Grouping Selectors

Selectors can be grouped together to apply the same style to multiple elements. This reduces redundancy and makes the CSS more maintainable.
```css
h1, h2, h3 {
   font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
}
```

### Descendant and Child Selectors

1. **Descendant Selector**:
   The descendant selector targets elements that are nested within another element. It is written by separating selectors with a space.
   ```css
   div p {
      color: blue;
   }
   ```

2. **Child Selector (`>`)**:
   The child selector targets direct children of a specific element.
   ```css
   ul > li {
      list-style-type: none;
   }
   ```
