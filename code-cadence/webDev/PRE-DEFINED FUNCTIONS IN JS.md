## 1.  console.log() 
`console.log` is a method in JavaScript that outputs messages to the web console. It's commonly used for debugging purposes to display information about the execution of your code, such as values of variables, outputs of functions, or simple messages.

```
	let greeting = " Wassu' Slime ?!" ;
	console.log(greeting) ; 

	let slime_num = 555 ;
	console.log("The Slime Number is :", slime_num) ;
```

## 1.  alert() 
The `alert()` function in JavaScript is used to display a modal dialog with a specified message and an "OK" button. It's often used to provide simple messages or notifications to the user. When alert() is called, it pauses the script execution until the user dismisses the alert by clicking "OK".

```
	alert("Hold! Write there!!") ; 
	alert("From Submitted Successfully!") ; 
```
