# Paragraphs
	Paragraphs can be separated by a blank line. 
	
	This is First Paragraph. 
	
	This is Second Paragraph. 
	
# Line Break   
	we can add a line break by trailing white spaces followed by return.  
	
# Emphasis
### Bold :
	we can bold anything by putting it inside two double asterisks.  
	**just like i've bolded this text.**

### Italic : 
	any text could be italicized by putting it inside 2 single asterisks.
	*this is an italic text* 

### Bold & Italic
	we use three asterisks (\*\) to bold and italic a text. 
	***this is a bold and italic text.*** 

# Blockquotes  
	To create a blockquote, add a > in front of a paragraph.
> This is an example of  block quote 

> This is another example of blockquote 
> 
> but with a blank line in between. to do so, we add a '>' in the blank line too. 

> yet another example of blockquotees but 
> 
>> this one is nested 
>> and fun fact is : 
>>>we can nest this
>>>>Endlessly. 
>>>> 


# Lists
	You can organize Items into Ordered and Unordered Lists. 

## Ordered lists:
	To create an ordered list, add line items with numbers followed by periods. The numbers donâ€™t have to be in numerical order, but the list should start with the number one.

1. Now we have 
2. some 
3. list 
4. going
5. on 
6. in  
7. here.
8. we can also 
	1. Nest 
	2. these
	3. lists. 
9. and be back to where we were. 
## Un-Ordered Lists: 
	To create an unordered list, add dashes (-), asterisks (\*), or plus signs (+) in front of line items. Indent one or more items to create a nested list. 

**Note :** but we have to be consistent with one sign.
- just 
- like 
- this 
- list
or..
+ like 
+ this 
+ one 

# Code
	To denote a word or phrase as code, enclose it in backticks (\`).

` #include<stdio.h> 
	int main(){
	
		return 0 ; 
	}
   }`

## Horizontal Rules
To create a horizontal rule, use three or more asterisks (***), dashes (---), or underscores (___) on a line by themselves.

*** 
---
___

# link 
	To create a link, enclose the link text in brackets (e.g., [Duck Duck Go]) and then follow it immediately with the URL in parentheses (e.g., (https://duckduckgo.com)).
	
	My favorite search engine is [Duck Duck Go](https://duckduckgo.com).

this is a [link](https://google.com)

#### titles : 
You can optionally add a title for a link. This will appear as a tooltip when the user hovers over the link. To add a title, enclose it in quotation marks after the URL.

[this is some link with some titles](https://google.com "this is some random ahh search engine")


# URLs and Email Addresses
	To quickly turn a URL or email address into a link, enclose it in angle brackets.

just like :  <ayus43@outlook.com> 

# Images
	To add an image, add an exclamation mark (!), followed by alt text in brackets, and the path or URL to the image asset in parentheses. You can optionally add a title in quotation marks after the path or URL.
